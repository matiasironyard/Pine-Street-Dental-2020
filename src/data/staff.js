I have been married for twenty-eight years and we have shared a son and daughter and are blessed with one granddaughter. We have a lively cat who is named Betty Davis for her beautiful eyes and cause she rules the home. I have worked in the dental field for twenty-six years. One of my greatest pleasures about working in dentistry has been getting to know the wonderful patients that visit the practice. I enjoy Gamecock events and spending time with family and friends.',

My passion for dentistry started in the late 70’s and I completely fell in love with it. I have worked in the same practice, under different ownership, over 41 years and I enjoy it as much as the first day. I enjoy shopping, making blankets, attending church, walking, a good glass of wine, grilling and spending time with my family.',
